## üéØ Demo Flow (5 Minutes)

### **MINUTE 1: Introduction (30 seconds)**

- Point to the contract address at the bottom

---

### **MINUTE 2: The Technology (45 seconds)**

**Say:**
> "We built this with Soroban smart contracts in Rust for the backend, and pure vanilla JavaScript on the frontend - no React, no frameworks. This demonstrates the power of Stellar's SDK."

**Show:**
- Open developer tools (F12)
- Show the console (clean, no framework overhead)
- Mention: "All transactions happen directly on Stellar Testnet"

---

## üìù Q&A Preparation

**Q: How is this different from Kickstarter?**
A: Kickstarter is centralized - they control the funds and take fees. StellarPledge uses a smart contract as the escrow, so it's trustless and has no fees.

**Q: Can you use tokens other than XLM?**
A: The architecture supports any Stellar token, but for this MVP we focused on native XLM.

**Q: How do you handle disputes?**
A: The code is the law - if the goal is met by deadline, creator gets funds. If not, automatic refunds. No disputes needed!

**Q: Is this production-ready?**
A: This is a working MVP on testnet. For production, we'd add proper wallet integration (like Freighter), more testing, and security audits.

**Q: How much did this cost to deploy?**
A: On Stellar testnet, it's free! On mainnet, deployment costs are minimal compared to other chains.

## üéØ Key Points to Emphasize

1. **Trustless** - No central authority controls the funds
2. **Fast** - Transactions settle in 3-5 seconds on Stellar
3. **Low Cost** - Minimal fees compared to traditional platforms
4. **Transparent** - All transactions visible on the blockchain
5. **Automatic** - Smart contract handles all logic

---

## üì∏ Screenshots to Have Ready

Consider having these screenshots prepared in case of technical issues:

1. Successful campaign creation
2. Pledge transaction in progress
3. Completed campaign with 100% funding
4. Claim funds button and success
5. Failed campaign with refund option
