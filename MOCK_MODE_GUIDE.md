# 🎭 MOCK MODE - Frontend-Only Demo Guide

## ✅ What Changed

I've switched StellarPledge to **MOCK MODE** for easier demos. Now:

### Frontend-Only Operations (Instant, No Blockchain):
- ✅ **Create Campaign** - Stored in localStorage, shows instantly
- ✅ **Make Pledges** - Updates in real-time, no wallet needed
- ✅ **View Campaigns** - All from localStorage, super fast
- ✅ **Update Status** - Goal reached? Instantly shows "Pending Approval"

### Blockchain Operations (Only When Ready):
- 🚀 **Complete Campaign** - THIS deploys to Stellar blockchain
- 🚀 **Claim Funds** - Calls smart contract

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### 1. Alice Creates Campaign

```javascript
// What happens:
✅ Campaign saved to localStorage immediately
✅ Shows in Creator Dashboard instantly
✅ Status: "active"
❌ NOT on blockchain yet!
```

### 2. Bob & Charlie Make Pledges

```javascript
// What happens:
✅ Pledges added to campaign.pledged
✅ Backer count increments
✅ Progress bar updates in real-time
✅ When goal reached → Status: "pending_approval"
❌ NOT on blockchain yet!
```

### 3. Alice Completes Campaign (Blockchain Time! 🚀)

```javascript
// What happens:
🚀 Calls createCampaign() on Soroban smart contract
🚀 Deploys to Stellar Testnet
✅ Gets blockchain campaign ID
✅ Status: "successful"
✅ Campaign now visible on stellar.expert
```

## 🎬 Demo Flow (Perfect for Presentation!)

### Step 1: Create Campaign (Instant ⚡)
1. Alice logs in as Creator
2. Clicks "Create Campaign"
3. Fills in:
   - Title: "Chronos Echo Film"
   - Goal: 100 XLM
   - Duration: 1 day
   - Perk: 50 XLM = 1 FOUNDER token
4. Clicks Create → **INSTANT!** ✅
5. Shows in dashboard immediately

### Step 2: Pledges (Instant ⚡)
1. Bob logs in as Funder
2. Pledges 30 XLM → Updates instantly
3. Charlie logs in as Funder
4. Pledges 80 XLM → Goal reached! Status: "Pending Approval"

### Step 3: Complete Campaign (Blockchain 🚀)
1. Alice sees "Complete Campaign" button
2. Clicks it → Now calling Soroban smart contract!
3. Transaction broadcasts to Stellar Testnet
4. Campaign deployed with all pledges
5. Status: "Successful" ✅

## 📂 Data Structure (localStorage)

```javascript
// Stored in: localStorage.getItem('stellarpledge_campaigns')
{
  id: 0,
  creator: "GDMT3K...",
  title: "Chronos Echo Film",
  description: "Sci-fi short film",
  goal: 100,
  pledged: 110, // Bob: 30 + Charlie: 80
  backers: 2,
  deadline: 1730000000000, // timestamp
  status: "pending_approval", // active | pending_approval | successful | failed
  rewardTier: {
    minAmount: 50,
    tokenName: "Founder Token",
    tokenCode: "FOUNDER",
    tokenSupply: 10
  },
  perkConfig: { threshold: 50, assetAddress: null, amount: 0 },
  pledgesList: [
    { backer: "GAY4A...", amount: 30, timestamp: 1729... },
    { backer: "GDQUP...", amount: 80, timestamp: 1729... }
  ],
  createdAt: 1729000000000,
  onBlockchain: false, // Changes to true after Complete
  blockchainId: null // Gets set after Complete
}
```

## 🎨 UI States

### Campaign Status Badge Colors:

| Status | Color | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `active` | 🟢 Green | Accepting pledges |
| `pending_approval` | 🟡 Yellow | Goal reached, awaiting creator |
| `successful` | 🔵 Blue | Completed & on blockchain |
| `failed` | 🔴 Red | Deadline passed, goal not met |

---

## 🚀 Complete Campaign Button

Only shows when:
- ✅ Campaign status is `pending_approval`
- ✅ User is the creator
- ✅ Goal has been reached

```jsx
{campaign.status === 'pending_approval' && (
  <Button onClick={() => handleCompleteCampaign(campaign.id)}>
    🚀 Complete Campaign (Deploy to Blockchain)
  </Button>
)}
```

- 🧪 **Safe testing** - Can't break anything

---

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Clear All Data (Start Fresh):
```javascript
// In browser console (F12):

## 🎯 Demo Script

### 2-Minute Quick Demo:

1. **Create Campaign** (10 seconds)
   - Alice creates "Test Campaign"
   - Goal: 100 XLM, Perk: 50 XLM
   - Instant creation ✅

2. **Make Pledges** (20 seconds)
   - Bob pledges 30 XLM
   - Charlie pledges 80 XLM

## 📊 What's on Blockchain vs. What's Not

### In localStorage (MOCK):
- ✅ Campaign creation
- ✅ Pledge tracking
- ✅ Status updates
- ✅ UI data (title, description, images)

### On Stellar Blockchain (REAL):
- 🚀 Final campaign deployment (via "Complete Campaign")
- 🚀 Smart contract interactions
- 🚀 Fund claims
- 🚀 Automated perk distribution

---

## 🔮 Future: Full Blockchain Mode

To switch back to full blockchain mode:
1. Change `handleCreateCampaign` to call `createCampaign()` immediately
2. Change `handlePledge` to call `pledge()` immediately
3. Change `loadAllCampaigns` to query blockchain
4. Remove `handleCompleteCampaign` function

**🎉 Now your demo will be smooth, fast, and error-free!**
