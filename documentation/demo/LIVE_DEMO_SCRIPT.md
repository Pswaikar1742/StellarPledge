---

### üì∏ Talking Point 3:
> "Charlie is an investor who pledged 4,000 XLM. Notice the green reward badge that appeared before he confirmed - this shows he's eligible for the FOUNDER token because his pledge exceeds the 3,000 XLM threshold.

## üé¨ ACT 4: ALICE VERIFIES SUCCESS (1 minute)

### Tab 1 - Back to Alice

**Refresh the Creator Dashboard** (F5 or click "Creator Dashboard" in header)

- üë• Total Backers: "2"
- ‚è≥ Active Campaigns: "0"
- ‚úÖ **Status Changed**: "Pending Approval" (green badge)

**Campaign Card Shows:**
- Progress: "6,000 / 6,000 XLM (100%)"
- "2 backers"
- Badge: "Pending Approval"

---

### üì∏ Talking Point 4:
> "Alice can now see her campaign reached its funding goal with 2 backers raising 6,000 XLM total. The status changed from 'Active' to 'Pending Approval'. In our smart contract, this would trigger the ability for Alice to claim the funds, while Bob and Charlie would have their pledges locked in escrow. If we had the contract deployed, Alice could click 'Claim Funds' and receive the 6,000 XLM, while Charlie would automatically receive his FOUNDER token."

---

## üé§ CLOSING REMARKS (30 seconds)

> "What you just saw is StellarPledge - a decentralized crowdfunding platform built on Stellar. Key innovations:
> 
> **1. Automated Reward Distribution**: Our Soroban smart contract automatically distributes tokens when pledge thresholds are met - no manual intervention needed.
> 
> **2. Multi-User Real-Time Updates**: Notice how all three users operated independently in separate sessions, with instant balance and progress updates.
> 
> **3. Threshold-Based Incentives**: The system intelligently tracks pledge amounts and determines reward eligibility in real-time.
> 
> **4. Production-Ready Architecture**: We have a complete Soroban smart contract written and a frontend that integrates with Stellar's Horizon API. For this demo, we used mock balances for speed, but we can switch to real testnet transactions instantly.
> 
> The entire flow - campaign creation, pledging, reward distribution, and fund claiming - is designed to run on-chain with zero trust required. Thank you!"

## üí° QUESTIONS JUDGES MIGHT ASK

**Q: Is this on the blockchain?**
> "We have a complete Soroban smart contract written. For this demo, we're using mock balances for speed and reliability, but the architecture supports real blockchain integration. I can show you Alice's real funded testnet account if you'd like."

**Q: Can you show the smart contract?**
> "Absolutely! The contract is in `/smart-contract/src/lib.rs`. It implements automated reward distribution via cross-contract token transfers - when a pledge meets the threshold, the contract automatically calls the token contract to transfer rewards."

**Q: What about security?**
> "Wallets are encrypted in localStorage, we use Stellar's official SDK for keypair generation, and the smart contract handles all fund escrow. In production, we'd add backend authentication, secure key management, and audit the contract before mainnet deployment."

**Q: How do users get refunds if campaign fails?**
> "The smart contract has a `withdraw_refund` function. If the deadline passes and the goal isn't met, backers can call this function to get their full pledge back from escrow."

**Q: Can you deploy this now?**
> "Yes! The contract is ready to deploy. It would take about 30 minutes to deploy to testnet and integrate with the frontend. We focused on building a complete feature set first."
