# 🎯 StellarPledge - Current State & MVP Status

## ⚠️ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: What's Currently Working

### 📊 Current Architecture: **FRONTEND MVP + SMART CONTRACT (NOT DEPLOYED)**

---

## 🔍 The Reality Check

### ✅ What You HAVE:

#### 1. **Smart Contract (Soroban) - WRITTEN BUT NOT DEPLOYED**
- ✅ Complete Rust smart contract code in `/smart-contract/src/lib.rs`
- ✅ Implements campaign creation, pledging, rewards, refunds
- ✅ Has automated perk distribution logic
- ✅ Ready for Stellar testnet deployment
- ❌ **NOT CURRENTLY DEPLOYED** to any network
- ❌ **NO CONTRACT ADDRESS** yet

#### 2. **Frontend Application - FULLY FUNCTIONAL (MOCK MODE)**
- ✅ Complete React application working perfectly
- ✅ Multi-user authentication system
- ✅ Wallet creation/import/connection
- ✅ Campaign creation wizard
- ✅ Pledge functionality
- ✅ Role-based dashboards
- ✅ **USES MOCK DATA** stored in localStorage
- ✅ **USES MOCK BALANCES** (10,000 XLM per user)

#### 3. **Wallet Integration - REAL STELLAR WALLETS (BUT OFFLINE)**
- ✅ Generates real Stellar keypairs
- ✅ Valid public/secret keys
- ✅ Can be viewed on stellar.expert
- ✅ Uses Stellar SDK
- ❌ **DOES NOT MAKE REAL TRANSACTIONS**
- ❌ **BALANCES ARE SIMULATED**

---

## 🔐 Wallet Status: Can You See Them on Stellar.expert?

### **YES, but...**

When you create a wallet in the app:
1. ✅ **Real Stellar keypair is generated** (using Stellar SDK)
2. ✅ **Public key is valid** (starts with G...)
3. ✅ **You CAN search it on stellar.expert**
4. ❌ **Account won't exist on testnet** (not funded/activated)
5. ❌ **Will show "Account not found"** or "Inactive"

### Example:
```
Public Key: GDMT3KZ3Q4S5YKPBCI7BGJB5H3ST7GF2IFRJVU34WEIE5UX5NZTW5FTF
```

**On stellar.expert/explorer/testnet:**
- Status: ❌ Account not found
- Reason: Never funded with real testnet XLM
- Solution: Fund it via friendbot or real XLM transfer

## 💾 How Data Currently Flows

### **Current Setup: localStorage Simulation**

```
User Action → Frontend Logic → localStorage → UI Update
     ↓
  (No blockchain interaction)
```

### What Happens When You:

#### **Create Campaign:**
```javascript
// Current implementation:
1. User fills form → Campaign object created
2. Saved to localStorage: 'stellarpledge_campaigns'
3. No smart contract call
4. No blockchain transaction
5. Only exists in your browser
```

#### **Make Pledge:**
```javascript
// Current implementation:
1. User clicks pledge → Balance checked (mock)
2. Balance deducted in localStorage
3. Campaign updated in localStorage
4. No XLM actually transferred
5. No blockchain record
```

#### **Connect Wallet:**
```javascript
// Current implementation:
1. Real keypair generated (Stellar SDK)
2. Public key stored in localStorage
3. Mock balance initialized (10,000 XLM)
4. No Horizon query for real balance
5. Account not activated on testnet
```

---

## 📋 localStorage Data Structure

### What's Actually Stored:

```javascript
// Browser localStorage contains:

1. 'stellarpledge_users' 
   [{id, name, email, password, role, createdAt}]

2. 'stellarpledge_current_user'
   {id, name, email, role, ...}

3. 'stellarpledge_campaigns'
   [{id, creatorId, title, goal, pledged, status, ...}]

4. 'stellarpledge_wallet_balances'
   {"GXXX...": 10000, "GYYY...": 8000}

5. 'stellarpledge_wallet'
   {publicKey, encryptedSecretKey, walletType, ...}
```

**None of this exists on Stellar blockchain!**

## 🔧 What Would Full Integration Require?

### **To Make It Fully Blockchain-Connected:**

#### Step 1: Deploy Smart Contract
```bash
cd smart-contract
stellar contract build
stellar contract deploy --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/stellar_pledge.wasm --network testnet
# Get contract ID: CXXXXXXX...
```

#### Step 2: Fund Demo Accounts
```bash
# Fund Alice's account
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=GDMT3KZ3Q4S5YKPBCI7BGJB5H3ST7GF2IFRJVU34WEIE5UX5NZTW5FTF"

# Fund Bob's account
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=GD4I6Y3FQW3PTNQAVP223YOFLHE66GTORJRGD55FWPZXI5SNCPU6NZNX"

# Fund Charlie's account  
curl "https://friendbot.stellar.org?addr=GC4GCLLQEERQXIHNYITVQINGT54UK3ZPHR5ACC6QKS2TKVS4YL3X7YVP"
```

#### Step 3: Update Frontend
```javascript
// In WalletContext.js - Change loadBalance:
const loadBalance = async (pubKey) => {
  // Remove mock balance logic
  const account = await server.loadAccount(pubKey);
  const xlmBalance = account.balances.find(b => b.asset_type === 'native');
  setBalance(xlmBalance ? parseFloat(xlmBalance.balance) : 0);
};

// In CampaignDetail.jsx - Add contract call:
const handlePledge = async () => {
  // Call deployed smart contract instead of localStorage
  const contract = new Contract(DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ID);
  await contract.pledge(campaignId, amount, publicKey);
};
```

#### Step 4: Add Transaction Signing
```javascript
// Connect with Freighter wallet for real signing
import { signTransaction } from '@stellar/freighter-api';

const tx = buildTransaction(operation);
const signedTx = await signTransaction(tx, 'TESTNET');
await server.submitTransaction(signedTx);
```

**Estimated Time:** 4-6 hours of work
