## 🎤 What to Say to Judges

### Opening:
> "StellarPledge solves the high-fee problem in crowdfunding by using blockchain technology. Traditional platforms charge 5-10% in fees. We charge zero. Let me show you how it works with a real scenario..."

### During Demo:
> "Notice how each transaction is instant, transparent, and recorded on the Stellar blockchain. The smart contract automatically manages the campaign state and ensures funds are only released when the goal is reached."

### Closing:
> "What you just saw is a fully functional decentralized crowdfunding platform. No middlemen, no payment processors, no waiting periods. Just instant, transparent, zero-fee crowdfunding powered by blockchain technology."

---

## 🎯 Key Selling Points

1. **Zero Platform Fees** - Traditional: 5-10% | StellarPledge: 0%
2. **Instant Settlement** - No waiting for payment processors
3. **Decentralized** - No single point of failure
4. **Transparent** - All transactions on public blockchain
5. **Trustless** - Smart contracts enforce rules automatically
6. **Global** - No geographic restrictions
7. **Fast** - 3-5 second transaction finality

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Quick Fixes:
1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Restart server:** `pkill -f http-server && ./run-demo.sh`
3. **Check console:** F12 for detailed errors
4. **Use backup:** Show screenshots instead

### Common Issues:
- **"Request failed 400"** - Already fixed! Transaction simulation added
- **Slow transactions** - Normal on testnet, wait 10-15 seconds
- **Account not found** - Accounts are funded and ready

See **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** for detailed solutions.
